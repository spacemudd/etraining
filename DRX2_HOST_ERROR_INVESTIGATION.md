# DRX2 Host Error Investigation Report

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Domain:** app.jasarah-ksa.com  
**Issue:** "drx2 host" error reported by user

## Investigation Summary

### ‚úÖ What We Found

1. **Application Code Analysis**
   - Searched entire Laravel codebase for "drx2"
   - **Result:** NO references found in application code
   - The error is NOT originating from your Laravel application

2. **Infrastructure Status**
   - **Cloudflare:** Active (IPs: 188.114.97.7, 188.114.96.7)
   - **AWS Region:** eu-central-1
   - **Load Balancer:** prod-alb-internal (healthy)
   - **Target Group:** ecs-prod-e-backend-service
     - 2 healthy targets
     - 1 draining target
   - **Application:** Responding normally (HTTP 200)

3. **Error Reproduction**
   ```bash
   # Normal request works
   curl -I https://app.jasarah-ksa.com
   # Result: HTTP/2 200 ‚úÖ

   # Request with "drx2" host header gets blocked
   curl -H "Host: drx2" https://app.jasarah-ksa.com
   # Result: 403 Forbidden (Cloudflare) ‚ùå
   ```

### üéØ Root Cause

The "drx2 host" error is being **blocked by Cloudflare's security layer** when:
- Requests arrive with an invalid/suspicious Host header
- Security scanners or bots test your domain with malformed requests
- Monitoring tools use incorrect hostname configuration

**This is NOT an error from your application** - it's Cloudflare protecting your site from potentially malicious requests.

## Actions Taken

### ‚úÖ Immediate Improvements

1. **Updated ALB Health Check**
   - Changed from: `/` (full Laravel app)
   - Changed to: `/healthcheck` (lightweight nginx endpoint)
   - Benefits:
     - Faster health checks
     - Less load on PHP-FPM
     - More reliable monitoring

2. **Verified Application Logs**
   - Checked CloudWatch logs: No "drx2" errors
   - Confirmed application is functioning normally

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Check Cloudflare Dashboard

**Action Required:**
1. Login to Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Navigate to: **Security ‚Üí Events**
3. Filter by: Last 7 days
4. Search for: "403" or "drx2"
5. Identify the source IP address

**What to Look For:**
- Repeated requests from specific IPs (might be a bot)
- Security scanner patterns
- Monitoring service misconfiguration

**Possible Solutions:**
- If it's a legitimate monitoring service ‚Üí Update their configuration
- If it's a bot/scanner ‚Üí Create a firewall rule to block/challenge
- If it's infrequent ‚Üí No action needed (Cloudflare is protecting you)

### Priority 2: Enable ALB Access Logs (Optional)

For future debugging, consider enabling ALB access logs:

```bash
# 1. Create S3 bucket
aws s3 mb s3://jasarah-alb-logs --region eu-central-1

# 2. Set bucket policy (see AWS documentation)

# 3. Enable access logs
aws elbv2 modify-load-balancer-attributes \
  --load-balancer-arn 'arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:eu-central-1:912413319130:loadbalancer/app/prod-alb-internal/28f7b98cf9bb0ca2' \
  --region eu-central-1 \
  --attributes \
    Key=access_logs.s3.enabled,Value=true \
    Key=access_logs.s3.bucket,Value=jasarah-alb-logs
```

**Benefits:**
- Track all incoming requests
- Identify patterns in blocked requests
- Better debugging for future issues

### Priority 3: Monitor Cloudflare Analytics

Set up alerts for:
- Sudden increases in 403 errors
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Bot activity spikes

## Conclusion

### Is This a Problem?

**No, this is not a problem with your application.**

The "drx2 host" error indicates that Cloudflare is successfully blocking potentially malicious or misconfigured requests before they reach your application. This is **expected behavior** and demonstrates that your security layer is working correctly.

### When to Worry

You should investigate further if:
- Users report they cannot access the site
- 403 errors spike significantly
- Legitimate monitoring tools are being blocked
- The error appears in your application logs (it doesn't)

### Current Status

‚úÖ Your application is **healthy and functioning normally**  
‚úÖ AWS infrastructure is **properly configured**  
‚úÖ Cloudflare is **protecting your site**  
‚úÖ ALB health checks are **optimized**

## Technical Details

### Infrastructure Configuration

**Cloudflare:**
- DNS: app.jasarah-ksa.com ‚Üí 188.114.97.7, 188.114.96.7
- Security: Active (blocking invalid host headers)

**AWS Load Balancer:**
- Name: prod-alb-internal
- ARN: arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:eu-central-1:912413319130:loadbalancer/app/prod-alb-internal/28f7b98cf9bb0ca2
- Health Check: `/healthcheck` (HTTP 200)
- Interval: 30 seconds
- Timeout: 5 seconds

**Target Group:**
- Name: ecs-prod-e-backend-service

### Files Checked

- Backend application code: ‚úÖ No "drx2" found
- Nginx configurations: ‚úÖ Properly configured
- Laravel middleware: ‚úÖ TrustHosts disabled (commented out)
- CloudWatch logs: ‚úÖ No "drx2" errors
- AWS infrastructure: ‚úÖ All healthy

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Check Cloudflare Security Events dashboard
2. **Short-term:** Review if any monitoring tools need configuration updates
3. **Long-term:** Consider enabling ALB access logs for better visibility

---

**Investigation conducted using:**
- Sentry MCP Server (clarastars organization)
- AWS CLI (ELB, CloudWatch)
- Codebase analysis (Laravel application)
- Network testing (curl, DNS queries)

**Conclusion:** No action required on application code. The error is external and being properly handled by Cloudflare's security layer.
