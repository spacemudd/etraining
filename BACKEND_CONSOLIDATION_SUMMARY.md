# Backend Consolidation Summary

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Status:** Code changes completed, AWS changes pending

## Changes Completed

### 1. Backend Nginx Configuration ✅
**File:** `backend/nginx.server.conf`
- Changed listen port from `9000` to `8085`
- Healthcheck endpoint remains at `/healthcheck` (now accessible on port 8085)

### 2. Backend Dockerfile ✅
**File:** `backend/Dockerfile`
- Changed EXPOSE from `8900` to `8085`
- Updated HEALTHCHECK to use `http://127.0.0.1:8085/healthcheck`

### 3. Docker Compose Configuration ✅
**File:** `docker-compose.yml`
- Removed entire `backend-web` service section
- Updated `backend` service to expose port 8085 directly
- Added port mapping: `80:8085`
- Added `restart: always` policy

### 4. Deployment Scripts ✅
**File:** `deploy-all.sh`
- Removed `backend-web` from build command
- Removed tagging for `etraining_backend-web:latest`
- Removed push for frontend ECR repository
- Removed frontend-service deployment commands

**File:** `deploy-backend-web.sh`
- ❌ Deleted (obsolete)

### 5. Directory Cleanup ✅
- ❌ Deleted `backend-web/` directory and all contents
  - Dockerfile
  - nginx.conf.tpl
  - openssl.conf
  - README.md

### 6. Documentation ✅
Created comprehensive AWS migration guide: `AWS_BACKEND_CONSOLIDATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## Architecture Changes

### Before:
```
Internet → Load Balancer → frontend-service (port 8085) → Internal ALB → backend-service (port 9000)
                            [nginx proxy]                                  [Laravel app]
```

### After:
```
Internet → Load Balancer → backend-service (port 8085)
                            [Laravel app with nginx]
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**
   - Reduced number of services from 4 to 3
   - Eliminated unnecessary proxy layer
   - Reduced infrastructure costs

2. **Improved Performance**
   - Removed extra network hop
   - Reduced latency
   - Less complex request routing

3. **Easier Maintenance**
   - Fewer services to monitor
   - Single container for web application
   - Simplified deployment process

4. **Better Resource Utilization**
   - Reduced container overhead
   - Lower memory footprint
   - Fewer ECS tasks to manage

## Next Steps (AWS Infrastructure)

See `AWS_BACKEND_CONSOLIDATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed steps:

1. ⏳ Create new backend task definition with port 8085
2. ⏳ Update backend service configuration
3. ⏳ Redirect load balancer traffic to backend service
4. ⏳ Verify deployment and health checks
5. ⏳ Scale down frontend-service to 0
6. ⏳ Monitor for 24-48 hours
7. ⏳ Delete frontend-service
8. ⏳ Clean up old target groups and task definitions

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after AWS deployment:
1. Scale backend service to 0
2. Scale frontend-service back to 2
3. Revert load balancer listener rules
4. Investigate and fix issues
5. Retry deployment

## Testing Recommendations

After AWS deployment:
- [ ] Verify application loads via public URL
- [ ] Test all major user flows
- [ ] Check CloudWatch logs for errors
- [ ] Monitor ECS service health
- [ ] Verify health check endpoint responds
- [ ] Test file uploads/downloads
- [ ] Verify database connectivity
- [ ] Check Redis connectivity
- [ ] Monitor application performance metrics

## Files Modified

- ✅ `backend/nginx.server.conf`
- ✅ `backend/Dockerfile`
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml`
- ✅ `deploy-all.sh`

## Files Deleted

- ❌ `backend-web/` (entire directory)
- ❌ `deploy-backend-web.sh`

## Files Created

- ✨ `AWS_BACKEND_CONSOLIDATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- ✨ `BACKEND_CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md`

## Notes

- The `web-proxy/` directory still exists but is not used in docker-compose.yml
- It appears to be legacy/alternative configuration and can be removed separately if confirmed obsolete
- Local development should work immediately with `docker-compose up`
- Production deployment requires AWS infrastructure changes as documented

## Related Services (Unchanged)

- ✅ `backend-worker` - Still running, no changes needed
- ✅ `backend-schedule` - Still running, no changes needed
- ✅ `db-service` - Still running, no changes needed
- ✅ `redis-service` - Still running, no changes needed

## ECS Cluster: prod-ecs-cluster

**Current Services:**
- ✅ backend-service (2 tasks) - Will be updated
- ✅ worker-service (running) - No changes
- ✅ scheduler (running) - No changes
- ⏳ frontend-service (2 tasks) - Will be deleted

## Estimated Time for AWS Changes

- Task definition update: 5 minutes
- Service update and deployment: 10-15 minutes
- Verification: 30 minutes
- Monitoring period: 24-48 hours
- Cleanup: 10 minutes

**Total:** ~1 hour active work + 1-2 days monitoring
